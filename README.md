# Project 'Webpage'

This website was created in order to practice my HTML and CSS skills.
It is also used as a school-project which makes up 40% of my grade in that class.

## What to expect:

The goal of this webpage will be a fully functional portfolio / Blog.
I'm still in the beginning phase where everything looks unprofessional and weird, but with time comes experience.

### In the future I'm going to implement as follows:

- [ ] Functional aboutMe page
- [ ] Functional contact page
- [ ] Functional contact-form
- [ ] Functional portfolio page
- [ ] Project displays
- [ ] Working Blog with Facebook-like features (Likes, Comments, Reactions)

I'll update the website regularly and every change will be documented in order for you to understand what I did / tried to do.
This ReadMe will also be updated every now and then.

Thank you for reading!

Greetings,
Adrian.
