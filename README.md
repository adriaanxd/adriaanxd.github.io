###Project 'Webpage'

This website was created in order to practice my HTML and CSS skills.
It is also used as a school-project which makes up 40% of my grade in that class.

I'll update the website regularly and every change will be documented in order for you to understand what I did / tried to do.
This ReadMe will also be updated every now and then.

Thank you for reading!

Greetings,
Adrian.
